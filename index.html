                 Hi, my name is Aryan Gandevia, and I am a future software engineer! I am currently in my second year at the University of Waterloo, study to achieve my Bachelor's
                 in Computer Science. High school was the first time I was introduced to programming, and ever since then, I have been hooked! Throughout my programming career,
                 I have picked up many different tech stacks, using a wide range of languages, frameworks, APIs and tools for the different projects I have worked on. <br><br>
                 
                 Aside from coding, I would like to say my life is decently well-rounded. Ever since I could remember, I've always played video games, with my top 3 being 
                 Destiny, Elden Ring and League of Legends. Outside of the virtual world, I really enjoy playing basketball and the piano. My favourite team is the Brooklyn Nets,
                 and my proudest accomplishment throughout my time playing the piano is that I completed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Dvg2MxQn8"> La Campanella</a>!
                 I've also started to go to the gym, with my year end 'lift goals' to be as follows: 
                 <br> - Squat: 275lbs
                 <br> - Deadlift: 315lbs
                 <br> - Bench: 225lbs
                 <br><br>
                 I could keep rambling on, but I won't hold you. If you want to connect further with me, use one of my social platforms to reach out to me,
                 and we can talk more there! Regardless, thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and I hope you enjoy the rest of my website!

            Mindspace is my first solo full-stack project, using React, Next.js, Google Firebase and Tailwind CSS. Mindspace is a small social media application that allows users
            to communicate via posts and comments. Users can view another user's posts and comment on them, post, edit and delete their own, and navigate through all the posts
            on the server. Within this project, I have created a fully function API capable of fetching, adding, deleting and editing values stored in the database, a fully safe 
            authentication system, and a database cluster. The <a href="https://mindspace-aryan-gandevia.vercel.app">website</a> is hosted using Vercel, and updates in real-time. 
            I am continuously working to develop more features on the website, so stay tuned for that. More information on the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/aryan-gandevia/Mindspace">here</a>. <br><br>

        UWVision
        <div class="h4Content">
            UWVision is a platform I helped develop in a small team, serving the purpose of allowing Waterloo students to share their co-op knowledge and experiences. This is through
            posting what jobs they had, the salary, the interview process and anything else relevant to how to get the position they did and what it entails. On my end, I developed resilient 
            endpoints in Django and responsive frontend components using React to display information fetched on the screen. I assisted in creating the application's API and constructed a few 
            pages of the site as well. I plan to continue my contributions to this application as I believe it has the potential to be a really useful resource to Waterloo students. To see the

            Auricular.AI is an application a group of friends and I developed for Hack the North 2020++. The application 
            takes an audio file and parses through it, returning the most "relevent" information to the user based off
            their relevence requirements. Currently, it is only applicable for work/school requirements, but with more 
            in-depth and diverse training of Wit.AI, we will be able to make its usage more widespread. This project is
            definitely one of my favourite pieces of collaborative work I've contributed towards. More information

        Blackbeard's Breakout
        <div class="h4Content">
            Although not the most technically impressive out of the projects I've worked on, this is my favourite 
            project I've worked on. Along with 2 of my friends, we constructed a fully functional 2-dimensional
            platformer game for our grade 12 computer science class' final project. The process of making this game
            was rigerous and definitely taught me a lot in terms of working skills and my coding abilities. If you

            Handpong is a motion-sensor based multiplayer game, where you use your hand to control your
            paddle in the game pong. Although it sounds like a simple idea, this project proved to be 
            very difficult to execute properly, in terms of the motion sensor working accurately,
            the multiplayer room functioning as intended and making sure the game was not super
            buggy/laggy. I worked mainly on constructing the game's frontend design and implementation
            of the four-player system of the game. For more information, click <a href="https://devpost.com/software/handpong">here</a>.<br><br>

            Validdit is the first large collaborative programming project I've worked on. The application reads a Reddit post, going through various statistics of it,
            such as its upvote:downvote ratio and the credibility of the account that posted it, and
            makes a decision on the validity of said post. I worked on frontend development, which was one of the first times I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. Comparing 
            my skills during this project to my current self, I can say that I have evolved a lot. If you are interested, it is delved into more detail
